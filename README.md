# Hello! I'm Given ✌️

I'm a web developer, designer, and dog enthusiast.

I work with React <img src="./images/react.svg" alt="react logo" height="20px"/>, Svelte , Node, and Python, as well as whatever I'm learning at the moment.

When I'm not coding I'm playing jazz piano, re-reading Carl Sagan, or enthusing over the aforementioned dogs.
